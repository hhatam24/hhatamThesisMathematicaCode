# hhatamThesisMathematicaCode

The code for the Mathematica code is contained in the file phiphiModuleConstruction.nb, which is a Mathematica notebook file.  Run the main module, called "computeSolns" by entering the partition of the dimension into \orthogonal direct sum of subspaces as a list in curly brackets : 
  "computSolns[{d1,d2,...]"

NOTE:  Running this for total dimension greater than 8, depending on the partition, may lead to hopelessly long computation times.
